## Summary
We have analysed our data through three categories: geographic, economic and mental health. The first category contains variables population, ecological footprint and location (continent). Our second category compares values using variables average well-being,happy life years,inequality of outcomes, inequality-adjusted life expectancy, and inequality-adjusted well-being. 
We will examine the changes within these three categories through years 2015 to 2020 and compare specifically years 2015-2019 and 2020 to understand the effects of the pandemic on the countries' happy planet indexes. 


Write-up of your project and findings go here. 
Think of this as the text of your presentation. 
The length should be roughly 5 minutes when read out loud.
Although pacing varies, a 5-minute speech is roughly 750 words. 
To use the word count addin, select the text you want to count the words of (probably this is the 
Summary section of this document, go to Addins, and select the `Word count` addin).
This addin counts words using two different algorithms, but the results should be similar and as long as you're in the ballpark of 750 words, you're good! 
The addin will ignore code chunks and only count the words in prose.

You can also load your data here and present any analysis results / plots, but I strongly urge you to keep that to a minimum (maybe only the most important graphic, if you have one you can choose). 
And make sure to hide your code with  `echo = FALSE` unless the point you are trying to make is about the code itself.
Your results with proper output and graphics go in your presentation, this space is for a brief summary of your project.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("hpi_2018_data.xlsx")
hpi_data <- data %>% clean_names()

glimpse(hpi_data)
```
